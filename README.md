# Caesar-Cipher
This is a classical encryption technique used, it is one of substitution cipher, where each letter in the text is right shifted by 3 places in the alphabetical order.
It is a technique where symmetric key is used. 
Encryption:
E(x)=(x+n) mod 26
Decryption:
D(x)=(x-n) mod 26
where x-character
      n-number of shift (if the n=3 then it is called Caesar )
